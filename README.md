# RestIt

RestIt is a Java framework for implementing easy to use RESTful web services clients on Android. It is a shameless attemp at replicating the capabilities of the excellent [RestKit iOS framework](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/). There are two goals. The first is to supply an easy to implement RESTFul client so that Android developers will never have to implement and parse their own HTTPClient requests. The second is to provide an object mapping engine that will automatically map server responses to application entity objects.
